**2FRC** is a browser-based regex extraction and comparison tool that streamlines pattern matching across two data sources. Simply provide **URLs**, **upload files**, or **paste text**, and 2FRC will apply your custom regular expression or its **default email regex** to extract, deduplicate, and compare matches. Results are displayed side‑by‑side, highlighting what’s **unique to Source A**, **unique to Source B**, and **common to both**.

### **Why It Stands Out**

Regex comparison and data extraction are often slow, error-prone, and scattered across scripts, grep sessions, and spreadsheets. 2FRC centralizes the workflow into a clean web interface, enabling analysts, engineers, and security teams to extract patterns, compare datasets, and identify actionable differences in just a few clicks—saving hours of manual work.

### **Key Capabilities**

* **Flexible Input:** Use two URLs, upload files, or paste text.
* **Default Email Regex:** Extract email addresses instantly, with zero setup.
* **Custom Regex Support:** Handle any valid pattern, even on large datasets.
* **Complete & Smart Comparison:** Extract all matches, view unique sets, and compare A-only, B-only, and shared matches.
* **Real-time Summaries:** Get instant counts, deduplicated results, and overlap insights.
* **Exportable Reports:** Download results for audits, QA, or automation.

### **Ideal Use Cases**

* Email or breach dataset validation and deduplication.
* Comparing logs, configs, or web-scraped data.
* Identifying missing data or mismatches between datasets.
* Data quality checks in ETL pipelines.
* QA testing for configuration or content consistency.
* Rapid triage of text feeds, emails, or structured/unstructured data.
